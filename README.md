Information of Interest to include Guides, Lists, Tools, Articles and Websites of Interest

This is where I place information that is interesting to me.  It includes Guides, Lists, Tools, Articles and Websites of Interest. <br>
Along my Software Testing Journey, I save information that is interesting to me here... <br>
Information may include heuristics, catalogs, guides, models, cheatsheets, lists, tools, articles and websites I find useful. <br>
Things that will help me in my testing... <br>
It is fluid and ever changing... <br>
